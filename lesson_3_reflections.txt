When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are collaborating with other team members

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the code pushed to GitHub might be from other collaborators that you would 
	want to check before pulling into local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	fork: Is a clone that takes place on GitHub servers
	clone: Is when you copy a repository from GitHub to a local repository, or
		   from a local repository to another local repository.
	branch: Is when you create a copy of the repository and give it a name tag, so that
			you have changes performed on this copy, and not any other.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can check this repository offline, and merge it with local repository
