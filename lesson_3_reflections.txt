When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are collaborating with other team members

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because the code pushed to GitHub might be from other collaborators that you would 
	want to check before pulling into local repository
